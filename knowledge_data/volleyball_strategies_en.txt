VOLLEYBALL DECISION-MAKING STRATEGIES FOR ATHLETES

SERVING DECISIONS

When to use a jump serve:
- Use jump serves when you have a strong lead (3+ points ahead)
- Jump serves are effective against teams with weak serve reception
- Avoid jump serves when you're behind or when serving errors could cost the set
- Best used by players with consistent jump serve technique (80%+ success rate)

When to use a float serve:
- Float serves are safer and more consistent
- Use when you need to avoid service errors
- Effective against teams with strong attackers (disrupts their rhythm)
- Recommended when score is close (within 2 points)

When to use a short serve:
- Target weak passers or players out of position
- Use when opponents are expecting deep serves
- Effective against teams with poor court coverage
- Best when you need to force a predictable attack

ATTACKING DECISIONS
